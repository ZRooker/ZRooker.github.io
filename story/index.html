                <div class="content">
                    <p>Zarek and Lauren met in February of their freshman year of college (2020). They had classes together and had two very short conversations the week before spring break… If you know anything about March of 2020, you know that they did not see each other again for months. No numbers were exchanged before the break, much to Lauren’s dismay, so she took it upon herself to find Zarek’s social media. A few weeks into the lockdown, Lauren got bored and wondered what that cute boy from her classes was doing, so she connected to the social media she found. After she had done this and Zarek had not reacted, she decided to start a conversation about the classes they were both completing online together. They continued to chat about school and life, then continued becoming virtual friends after the semester ended. When it was announced that classes would be in person that fall, they made plans to hang out in person. The first time they hung out was so much fun, they decided to do it again. They also had a class together, so they spent lots of time studying together as well. Zarek says it was obvious he wanted to be her friend, but Lauren is convinced he was too nice to ask her to leave him alone. </p>
                    <p>For all of the fall of 2020, they became better and better friends, constantly losing track of time when hanging out together. Even studying Physics II became a fun event (imagine that!). Lauren developed a crush on Zarek over that semester and was not subtle about it, but he just wanted to be friends by the end of the semester. She decided that as long as they could be friends, she would be okay. To convince everyone else of this, she often said “we are just friends” without being asked when talking about him to all of her friends and family. No one was convinced. After the winter break, when they hadn’t been able to spend much time together, Zarek finally decided he liked Lauren back. He told her as much, then they went on a date together, and Lauren still thought he just wanted to be friends. They still debate whether that was their first date or not. Despite this misunderstanding, they decided to become a couple on Sunday January 24, 2021 as he dropped her off at the Zeta house. </p>
                    <p>Since then, the two have been inseparable. Some of their favorite dates together have been a fancy steak dinner in OKC for their 2nd anniversary, a trip to The Weeknd’s concert before senior year  , and an adventure to Eureka Springs on a whim during Christmas time. They have loved every snow day spent adventuring in the snow together (frozen eyelashes and all), every quick meal between obligations (why was Lauren ALWAYS busy?), and every lego set they have built together. They both knew pretty early on that they were meant for each other. They have been through tough semesters together, a summer of internships that were more than 10 hours away from each other, the passing of family pets, and the stress of finding a job after college. Through all of that, they still knew they wanted to get married. </p>

                <!-- <h2> January 24th 2021 - Today </h2> -->
                <div class="content">
                    <p>The two looked at rings together several times during the fall of 2022, and had decided that they wanted to get engaged during the spring semester. Neither of them knew how their last semester of college would bring such different circumstances for the two. Lauren was taking fewer classes then ever and was assigned a Senior Design group that made the project fairly stress free.  Zarek was one of four people on his project and worked tirelessly throughout the semester to complete it, along with school work that was not any easier than the semesters before. Knowing they were planning on getting engaged, Zarek bought the ring at the beginning of the semester and had it in February. Originally, he wanted to propose on their second anniversary, but being the procrastinating college student that he was, that didn’t exactly work out.  Then he  planned on asking her to marry him at the end of February, but she randomly decided to go to a conference in Columbia, Missouri that weekend. Zarek then searched for another weekend where they could go on a date out of town  so he could ask her the question she wanted him to ask, but Lauren planned something every single weekend until the end of April. From Spring break in Nashville, to the Taylor Swift concert in Dallas, she was determined to make the most of her last semester and unknowingly delayed her engagement.
                    </p>
                    <p>By the time she had a free weekend, Lauren was wondering why it was taking Zarek so long to propose (I wonder why?). Knowing that she wanted it to be a surprise, 
                    he had convinced her that he wouldn’t be ready to propose until after school got out. She was okay with the change of plans because she knew that no matter what they would be together (ask her roommates and sister how okay with it she was). As the semester continued, they both worked hard on their senior design projects and in their classes. On April 28th, they both presented their projects and most of the stress from the semester was no longer present. Because the presentations were over, Lauren had no clue what Zarek was planning when they decided to take a trip to the Philbrook Museum in Tulsa as a celebratory date. </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>Upon their arrival, they walked through the museum and he even grabbed a souvenir for a random exhibit (this is weird if you know Zarek, but Lauren had no clue).  Eventually Zarek started rushing them through the museum telling Lauren he was worried they wouldn’t see everything before the museum closed.    By that point Lauren knew it definitely wasn’t her day to get engaged. There was even a wedding happening there that she kept making lots comments to him about. They eventually got to the garden where he was determined to get to the Tempietto to get on one knee. Lauren was clueless, even as she spotted a very conspicuous looking photographer. When they got to the top of the steps in the Tempietto, Zarek grabbed both of her hands, and got strangely serious. Lauren was shocked into silence when she caught on. He said, “Lauren, you are the love of my life and I want to spend the rest of it making you happy.” He knelt down on one knee and asked her to marry him.  She  obviously said yes, though she had to ask him to make sure she had actually said yes.  
                    </p>
                    <p>They then took tons of beautiful pictures and wandered the rest of the museum until it closed. On the drive back to Stillwater, Lauren didn’t shut up once about the engagement and asked too many questions. Once they got to Stillwater, they joined a group friends and family to celebrate the occasion. It was the most perfect day.

                <h2>Lauren Millis </h2>
                <p>Until recently, Lauren had lived in Stillwater, OK for her entire life. She went to Will Rogers Elementary School, Stillwater Middle School, Stillwater Junior High School, then Stillwater High School. During her high school experience, she discovered her love for math and science, and a teacher of hers helped her realize that engineering might be a good fit for her. For college, she moved a whole 10 minutes away from her family to attend Oklahoma State University. She stayed busy in college by becoming a part of every club, organization, or honor society she heard about. Lauren met so many incredible people at OSU, including the love of her life. In May of 2023, she graduated with a Bachelors degree in Industrial Engineering and Management, and currently works as an Analytics Specialist at Phillips 66 in Houston.</p>
                <p>Lauren has been so thankful to be surrounded with so much love and support throughout her life from all of her friends and family. Lance and Linda, her mom and dad, instilled a love of learning in her from an early age, and supported everything she decided to pursue. Her sister, Lindsay, has been the biggest blessing in her life. Lindsay is Lauren’s built-in best friend, and though they have fought a LOT over the years, she has always been such a light in Lauren’s life. Her grandparents, Dottie and Bill Millis, and Patsy and Bill Brooks have been fantastic role models for her throughout her life. Though Dottie and Bill are no longer with us, she works hard to make all of her grandparents proud. </p>

                <p>Zarek was born and raised in Shawnee, Oklahoma. He attended Bethel Public Schools from Pre-K through high school. Additionally, Zarek was a part-time student at Gordon Cooper Technology Center, where he not only formed lasting friendships but also discovered his true passion for engineering. After graduating from high school, he pursued his dreams at Oklahoma State University. During his time there, he forged numerous valuable friendships, found the love of his life, and acquired a wealth of knowledge. In May of 2023, he proudly graduated with a dual degree in Computer and Electrical Engineering and has since embarked on a career as a Controls Engineer in Houston, Texas.</p>
                <p>Zarek is deeply appreciative of the friendships he has made at various stages of his life and the unwavering support of his family. His family, especially his parents, Mandy and Steven, showered him with love and encouragement as he pursued his dreams and ambitions. His siblings, Madax (Max), Riley, and Hailey, have been his partners in adventure. His grandparents, Chris and Mike Rooker, have served as his ultimate role models. Their wisdom, kindness, and unwavering commitment to family values have left an indelible mark on his life. 
                    Finally, his Nana has consistently been the most vocal and enthusiastic supporter in every setting. In every phase of Zarek's journey, his family has been there to uplift him, provide a safety net, and celebrate his successes. </p>
