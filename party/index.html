                <h2>Lindsay Millis</h2>
                <p>Lauren met Lindsay when she was born (But started talking to her months before). Lauren doesn’t remember much about that day, but she thinks she remembers receiving an awesome wooden play kitchen set as a gift from her grandparent in exchange for becoming an older sister. Little did she know, the person who entered the world that day would be stealing that set from her for years to come. Anyone who knows the sisters knows that they loved each other just as much as they fought when they were little, which was a lot (Ask them about the holes they put in the wall). As they got older, the fighting stopped, and they became the best of friends. Though they still don’t agree on everything, the two are inseparable and always have the other’s back. They have talked about their wedding days since they were little girls, and Lauren feels so blessed to have such an amazing sister to act as her Maid of Honor. </p>
                <p>Lindsay is currently a Sophomore at Oklahoma State University studying Pre-Nursing. She has applied to be a part of the first class of students in the nursing program at OSU. Lindsay and her boyfriend of 3 years, Jayden, love to build Lego sets together. Lindsay also loves to read and crochet, which she discusses with Lauren frequently. She also spends lots of time looking at Bernese Mountain dog puppies and planning for the one she will have later in life. </p>

                <h2>Hailey Rooker</h2>
                <p>Lauren met Hailey during the summer of 2021 after Zarek introduced her to his family. Having seen many shows and movies, Lauren was nervous to meet his sister. Hailey, however, was incredibly kind and welcoming from the first time they met. Knowing that she had to put up with Zarek through all of their lives, Lauren is also impressed that she was able to keep him and his brothers in check. More recently, the two talk often about crafting and their current projects. Every time Lauren spends time with Hailey, it feels like hanging out with a sister, and she is so excited to become Hailey’s (and also to have someone else to ask about family plans to double check the information from Zarek). Though they haven’t known each other for long, Lauren is so thankful for the friendship they have built, and didn’t hesitate to ask Hailey to be a bridesmaid. </p>
                <p>Hailey currently works as a second-grade teacher at the elementary school where her mom is now a counselor. This is her first year teaching, but she took over the classroom her mom taught in before her. She is a loving dog parent, with her boyfriend Tsegaye, to their two dachshunds, London and Stark. She also loves to make friendship bracelets and is learning to crochet in her free time. </p>

                <h2>Taylor Winfrey </h2>
                <p>Lauren met Taylor the summer before their Freshman year after they were randomly assigned to be roommates. Knowing how randomly assigned roommate situations usually go, Lauren was apprehensive. However, they hit it off immediately and she instantly knew they would be friends. Though their time as roommates was cut short (thanks COVID), they spent more time together than they did with anyone else that year and became the best of friends. Taylor not only put up with Lauren’s incessant singing at all hours of the day, lights on while Lauren studied and she slept, and the literal fire-hazard that Lauren turned her side of the room into, but she also never complained about any of it, willingly joined in any shenanigans Lauren suggested, and made Lauren laugh more than anyone she had ever met. They were the roommate story that the college LOVED to talk about because they became best friends. Though they spent less time together after COVID and lived separate places, Taylor continues to make Lauren laugh every time they speak, and Lauren can’t imagine life without her! Lauren knew after a very short time being roommates that Taylor would be standing with her on her wedding day. </p>
                <p>Taylor is currently pursuing her masters degree at Oklahoma State University, and plans to become a speech pathologist. When Taylor has the rare time to spare, she loves to read. She is also a very talented cook and baker.</p>

                <h2> Sloane Johnson</h2>
                <p>Lauren met Sloane in a rather unconventional way. When Lauren’s dad, Lance, was leading orientation sessions for incoming engineering freshmen, and Sloane was one of those students. As he talked with her and her mother, Lance decided that she would be an awesome friend for his own incoming engineering freshman, Lauren. The two did get in contact, and Sloane became Lauren’s first college friend. They were not only both engineering students, they also shared many things in common, and were members of several of the same organizations. They spent lots of time together and became better friends during Freshman and Sophomore year, then Sloane asked Lauren to join a group of girls with her that were all renting a house together Junior year. They lived together from the summer of 2021 until they graduated in 2023. Since they met, Sloane has been one of Lauren’s biggest supporters and has always made her feel so loved and appreciated. Lauren knew that support would continue when she asked Sloane to be her bridesmaid. </p>
                <p>Sloane currently works as a Civil Engineer at an engineering consulting firm called Langan in Austin Texas. Sloane and her boyfriend, Austin, love to travel, and recently went to Germany together. In her free time, Sloane mentors high school aged girls in a young life group. She also spends lots of time learning to cook impressive meals. </p>

                <h2>Mika Lucas - Matron of Honor</h2>
                <p>Lauren met Mika when Mika was in college and began babysitting Lauren and her sister. The three of them spent countless hours together over the span of a several years, driving them to and from school, taking them to tennis and swim lessons, and entertaining them in many creative and fun ways. After she graduated, Mika married Kyle Lucas and they both began working at Stillwater Public Schools, where both girls eventually attended, and they remained close friends of the Millis family. When the Lucas family welcomed their children into the world, they invited the Millis family into the lives of their kids as well. The girls began to babysit their three kids and have continued to do so since their oldest was born. Through the years, the Lucas family has become a part of Lauren’s family. Lauren and her sister both think of Mika as their sister. Lauren could not imagine getting married without Mika at her side. </p>
                <p>Mika currently works at Westwood Elementary School as a Counselor. She is an amazing mom to her three kids, Collins, Brooks, and Quinn.</p>

                <p>Justin has been Zarek's best friend since forever. They're practically twins, born just 7 days apart (the best 7 days of his life). Their friendship began in pre-kindergarten and has endured since. Their mothers' shared workplace meant that they spent countless hours together, from early mornings to the occasional shared class.</p>
                <p>Despite life's inevitable ups and downs, their friendship has remained resilient. Whether it was attending high school church socials, embarking on summer excursions to Eufaula, or hitting the local bars together, their camaraderie endured. Even now, separated by 400 miles, they maintain their connection through late-night gaming sessions. They've done it all, and neither time nor distance can stop their shenanigans.</p>

                <p>Cooper has been an incredible friend throughout Zarek's high school and college years. They were both part of a tight-knit group of friends from GCTC, and to this day, five of them remain close.
                    Cooper has always been the kind of friend you want by your side.Cooper has been instrumental in broadening Zarek's perspective on art, music, and entertainment. If anyone needs excellent movie recommendations, he's the person to ask. His unmatched passion for creativity is truly admirable.</p>
                <p>One of their shared passions is basketball. They've spent years playing and watching games together, bonding over their mutual love for the sport. As two of the biggest OKC fans ever, it's their duty to watch and now discuss every game they can.</p>

                <p>Titled as cousins, but sharing a bond closer than brothers, they spent countless nights annoying their grandparents together. Some of their fondest memories stem from those nights spent with him. From engaging in intense 1v1 matches in the freezing cold, to lazy pool days, and adventurous trips to Branson, they shared it all.
                </p>
                <p>Josh infused a competitive spirit into Zarek and consistently pushed him to excel. As his unofficial big brother, he always found comfort in knowing he had his back. Today, witnessing the man he has become, he couldn't be prouder.</p>

As they matured, their bond deepened, cementing their relationship as brothers. He's a driven individual, securing a job at an earlier age than any of them, a trait Zarek greatly admires. Despite being the youngest, Riley exhibited a lot of independence early also. Riley possesses an exceptional taste in music. Zarek's is sorry Riley had to be his roommate for all those years.  </p>

                    <p>Ainsley and Lauren met before Freshman year at an event for the President’s Leadership Council program. They were placed in the same small group, so they spent a lot of their time together. The two also both decided that year to major in Industrial Engineering and Management, so they spent almost every day of the rest of college together.

Before senior year of college, after they renewed their lease, the two of them moved into the same room. Before being roommates with Hailey, Lauren would stay up until the early morning hours on a regular basis, but Hailey going to bed around 10 pm every night influenced Lauren, who now gets a full night’s sleep regularly thanks to her. Hailey was an awesome unexpected friend, and Lauren is so glad she is a part of her wedding. </p>
                    <p>Hailey currently works as a first grade teacher at a Jenks elementary school and is also attending OSU classes at the Tulsa campus to get her master’s degree in School Counseling, which she will complete next May.</p>

                    <h2>Josephine (Jo) Lee </h2>
                    <p>Lauren and Jo met at a welcome event for a scholarship program they were both a part of. They were also frequently partners in the Chemistry Labs they shared, though that sometimes meant spending long hours getting only wrong answers for their assignment. Through other engineering classes and their involvement in the scholarship program, they became great friends and spent lots of time together outside of those things as well. Their friendship is something Lauren cherishes so she was excited to ask Jo to be a part of her big day.</p>
                    <p>Jo is currently working as a civil engineer in Oklahoma City where she gets to design bridges and has worked on several impressive projects. </p>
                    <p>Hobbies: Jo is very talented in her creativity and paints often (ask her about her bridge paintings), but she has also taken up crocheting recently. </p>

                    <h2>Kristen Anthamatten</h2>
                    <p>Sorority recruitment initially brought Kristen and Lauren together because they lived in the same dorm, but they soon found out they were neighbors. They later moved into their college house together before Junior year started, and became much better friends. The two shared lots of laughs, many movie nights and countless silly adventures while they were roommates. Kristen was always willing to chat, or participate in anything the roommates proposed, and is talented at making others laugh. That quality is one of the reasons Lauren knew Kristen had to be there with her on May 18th.  </p>
                    <p>Kristen is currently living in Kansas City, attending graduate school at the University of Kansas to become a dietitian. </p>
                    <p>Fun Fact: Kristen has danced for most of her life and participated in Varsity Revue in college. Because of this, Kristen can do the splits (given a little warning and some stretching beforehand).</p>

                    <p>Neither Lela or Lauren is exactly sure when they met, but from middle school through high school, they were in orchestra together. Since they both played the violin, they were often paired to sit next to each other and share a music stand. Once they started college, they had several classes together over the years and were also both a part of the College of Engineering Student Council throughout college. They have become great friends over the years. Lela is one of Lauren’s oldest friends and she is so excited Lela is able to be a part of her wedding!</p>
                    <p>Lela currently works as a Civil Engineer for Burns and McDonnell in Oklahoma City, and she works on water projects, such as water lines, stormwater management, and water/wastewater treatment plants. </p>
                    <p>Fun fact: Lela loves hiking and does so as often as she can. She has also been to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. </p>

                    <h2>Lillie Snyder</h2>
                    <p>The Freshman Representative Council was a group of Freshman that learned about the OSU Student Government Association, and Lauren and Lillie were each selected to join the council. Though they were occasionally mistaken for each other (though neither of them is really sure why), they became great friends through their involvement. They also shared several friends, and ended up spending a significant amount of time together where they studied and also did anything but studying. So many of Lauren’s college memories involve Lillie, and her wedding day is one she also wanted Lillie to be a part of. </p>
                    <p>Lillie earned her degree in Biochemistry last May, and has been working at both a chemotherapy and a mixed animal veterinary practice during a gap year. She has been admitted to vet school and will likely be moving to attend the University of Missouri in the fall.</p>
                    <p>Hobbies: In her free time, Lillie takes care of her own pets, which include Elvis the Australian Shepard, and Blueberry the chicken, and a few more.</p>

                    <p>Lauren lived in a room diagonal across the hall from Sarah during freshman year, but the two first met during sorority recruitment before school started. Once classes started, the two had many classes together, which continued all the way through college since they were both Industrial Engineering majors. They spent countless hours studying together for the exams and assignments they both had, but they also goofed off with many Bachelor nights and many other random adventures. Getting married is one of the adventures that Lauren can’t imagine without Sarah as a part of it. </p>
                    <p>Sarah is currently pursuing her MBA at OSU and will graduate in May. She was able to start her MBA classes during undergrad, so she has expedited her Master’s degree.</p>
                    <p>Hobbies: Sarah loves to travel. She has been to Spain, Hawaii, and is travelling to several European countries again in March. </p>

                    <p>When Taylor agreed to live with a group of girls for her junior year of college, she was unaware that meant she would share a room with Lauren. After they signed the lease, they moved in together and luckily got along really well. The two stayed up many nights talking about anything and everything the year they shared a room, and even after. There are also songs Lauren can’t listen to without thinking of Taylor because she cued them 20 times in a row or because she led the charge of the whole house screaming them at the top of their lungs. Taylor has always been such a fun person to be around, and Lauren knew she would be just as energetic and encouraging at her wedding. </p>
                    <p>Taylor currently lives in Savannah Georgia where she works for Enmarket Arena. She works on graphic designs and manages social media for the arena, and also learned how to drive a Zamboni for work (admit it, you’re also jealous). </p>
                    <p>Hobbies: Taylor loves music, reading, and going on walks. She always has the best book recommendations!</p>

                    <p>Collins Lucas is a beautiful and sassy 9-year old, who will be serving as a Junior Bridesmaid. At first, she was unsure what that meant, but she is super excited to stand up at the alter with Lauren, her favorite Millis sister, Lindsay, and her mom, Mika. Collins loves all things beauty related, and will rarely be seen without a bit of lipstick and the prettiest painted nails. She also plays basketball, dances, and does gymnastics, which takes up most of her free time. Lauren is so excited Collins will be able to stand up there with her on her wedding day.</p>
                    <p>Brooks Lucas is a handsome and energetic 6-year old, who will be serving as a ring bearer. He will take his title very seriously and there will not be any funny business. Well, maybe a little funny business. Brooks loves sports, and often golfs with both of his parents. He also plays basketball and baseball with his friends. Lauren can’t think of anyone better to entrust with the </p>
                    <p>Molly Quinn Lucas is the daredevil of the three Lucas kids, at just 3 years old. She will be serving as the flower girl, which means she gets to wear a princess dress! Yay! With two older siblings, MQ learned very quickly that she needs to keep up with them and is always excited to do what they do. She loves singing, all things Disney Princesses, and whatever her siblings are doing. She is the perfect person to take on the task of leading the way for Lauren down the aisle. </p>
