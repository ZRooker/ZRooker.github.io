                    <p>Until recently, Lauren had lived in Stillwater, OK for her entire life. She went to Will Rogers Elementary School, Stillwater Middle School, Stillwater Junior High School, then Stillwater High School. During her high school experience, she discovered her love for math and science, and a teacher of hers helped her realize that engineering might be a good fit for her. For college, she moved a whole 10 minutes away from her family to attend Oklahoma State University. She stayed busy in college by becoming a part of every club, organization, or honor society she heard about. Lauren met so many incredible people at OSU, including the love of her life. In May of 2023, she graduated with a Bachelors degree in Industrial Engineering and Management, and currently works as an Analytics Specialist at Phillips 66 in Houston.</p>
